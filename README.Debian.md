An Okapi repo for Debian packaging
----------------------------------

This is a "downstream" Okapi repository that includes Debian packaging files.  
It is maintained via git-buildpackage and consists of two branches: 

*  debian-upstream - This branch contains the upstream source imported from https://github.com/folio-org/okapi.
*  debian/debian - This branch contains the Debian packaging files in the directory debian with upstream source merged and tagged. 

Any work on the Debian package files should be done in branch debian-debian.

This repository is currently *experimental*.
