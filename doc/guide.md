## Introduction

This document aims to provide an overview of concepts that relate to Okapi and
the entire ecosystem around it (e.g. core vs modules) as well as details of the
implementation and usage of Okapi: by presenting concrete web service
endpoints and details of request processing -- handling of request and
response entities, status codes, error conditions, etc.

Okapi is an implementation of some different patterns commonly used within
the microservice architecture. The most central of them is the so called "API
Gateway" pattern which is implemented by the core Okapi 'proxy' service.
Conceptually, the API Gateway is a server that is a single entry point into
the system. It is similar to the
[Facade pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern)
from object-oriented design. Per the [standard
definition](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-using-an-api-gateway/),
which Okapi follows quite closely, _the API Gateway encapsulates the
internal system architecture and provides a unified API that may be
tailored to each client; it might also include core responsibilities
such as authentication, monitoring, load balancing, caching, request
shaping and management, and static response handling_: from the Message
Queue design pattern to allow broadcasting of requests to multiple
services (initially synchronously and eventually, possibly,
asynchronously) and returning a final response. Finally, Okapi
facilitates communication between services by acting as a Service
Discovery tool: service A wanting to talk to service B only needs to
know its HTTP interface since Okapi will inspect the registry of
available services to locate the physical instance of the service.

Okapi is designed to be configurable and extensible -- it allows one to
expose new, or enrich existing, web service endpoints without a need
for programmatic changes to the software itself. Registration of new
services ('modules' as seen from Okapi) happens by making calls to the Okapi
core web services. It is envisioned that the registration, and associated core
management tasks, will be performed by the Service Provider
administrator. This configurability and extensibility is necessary to
allow for app store features in which services or groups of services
('applications') can be enabled or disabled per tenant on demand.

## Architecture

Web service endpoints in Okapi can be, roughly, divided into two
parts: (1) general module and tenant management APIs, sometimes
referred to as 'core' -- initially part of Okapi itself but potentially
separable into their own services -- and (2) endpoints for accessing
module-provided, business-logic specific interfaces, e.g. Patron
management or Circulation. This document will discuss the former in
detail and offer a general overview of allowed formats and styles for
the latter.

The specification of the core Okapi web services, in its current form,
is captured in [RAML](http://raml.org/) (RESTful API Modeling
Language). See the [Reference](#web-service) section.  The
specification, however, aims to make very few assumptions about the
actual API endpoints exposed by specific modules, which are basically
left undefined.  The goal is to allow for different styles and formats
of those APIs (RESTful vs RPC and JSON vs XML, etc.) with only the
basic requirement of a common transport protocol (HTTP). It is
envisioned that the transport protocol assumption may be lifted or
worked around for some special cases (e.g. the ability to integrate
non-HTTP, binary protocols, such as a truly asynchronous protocol for
operation similar to a message queue).

### Okapi's own Web Services

As mentioned, Okapi's own web services provide the basic functionality
to set up, configure and enable modules and manage tenants. The core
endpoints are:

 * `/_/proxy`
 * `/_/discovery`
 * `/_/deployment`
 * `/_/env`

The special prefix `/_` is used to to distinguish the routing for Okapi
internal web services from the extension points provided by modules.

 * The `/_/proxy` endpoint is used for configuring the proxying service:
   specifying which modules we know of, how their requests are to be
   routed, which tenants we know about, and which modules are enabled for
   which tenants.

 * The `/_/discovery` endpoint manages the mapping from service IDs to network
   addresses on the cluster. Information is posted to it, and the proxy service
   will query it to find where the needed modules are actually available. It also
   offers shortcuts for deploying and registering a module in one
   go. There is only a single discovery endpoint covering all of the
   nodes in a cluster. Requests to the discovery service can also deploy
   modules on specific nodes, so it is rarely necessary to invoke
   deployment directly.

 * The `/_/deployment` endpoint is responsible for deploying modules.
   In a clustered environment there should be one instance of the
   deployment service running on each node. It will be responsible
   for starting processes on that node, and allocating network addresses
   for the various service modules. It is mostly used internally, by the
   discovery service, but is left open in case some cluster management
   system could make use of it.

 * The `/_/env`  endpoint is used to manage environment variables -- system-wide
   properties that are passed to modules during deployment.

These four parts are coded as separate services, so that it will be possible
to use alternative deployment and discovery methods, if the chosen clustering
system offers such.

![Module Management Diagram](module_management.png "Module Management Diagram")

#### What are 'modules'?

Modules in the Okapi ecosystem are defined in terms of their _behavior_
(or, in other words, _interface contract_)  rather than their _contents_,
meaning there is no exact definition of a module as a package or an archive,
e.g. with the underlying file structure standardized.
Those details are left to the particular module implementation (as noted
before, Okapi server-side modules can utilize any technology stack).

Hence any piece of software that manifests the following traits can become
an Okapi module:

* It is an HTTP network server that communicates using a REST-styled
web service protocol -- typically, but not necessarily, with a JSON payload.

* It comes with a descriptor file, namely the
[`ModuleDescriptor.json`](../okapi-core/src/main/raml/ModuleDescriptor.json), which
declares the basic module metadata (id, name, etc.), specifies the module's dependencies
on other modules (interface identifiers to be precise), and reports all
"provided" interfaces.

* `ModuleDescriptor.json` has a list of all `routes` (HTTP paths and methods)
that a given module handles, this gives Okapi necessary information to proxy
traffic to the module (this is similar to a simplified RAML specification).

* It follows versioning rules defined in the chapter
[_Versioning and Dependencies_](#versioning-and-dependencies).

* WIP: it provides interfaces required for monitoring and instrumentation.

As you can see, none of those requirements specifically state rules for
deployment and, as such, it would be entirely possible to integrate
a third party web service (e.g. the API of a publicly accessible Internet server)
as an Okapi module. That is, assuming the endpoint style and versioning
semantics are a close match for what is required in Okapi, and a
suitable module descriptor can be written to describe it.

Okapi, however, includes additional services (for service deployment and
discovery) that allows it to execute, run and monitor services natively
on a cluster that it manages. Those _native modules_ require an additional
descriptor file, the
[`DeploymentDescriptor.json`](../okapi-core/src/main/raml/DeploymentDescriptor.json),
which specifies the low-level information about how to run the module. Also,
native modules must be packaged according to one of the packaging options
supported by Okapi's deployment service: at this point that means providing
the executable (and all dependencies) on each node or using on a self-contained
Docker image to distribute the executable from a centralized place.


#### API guidelines

Okapi's own web services must, and other modules should, adhere to these
guidelines as far as practically possible.

 * No trailing slashes in paths
 * Always expect and return proper JSON
 * The primary key should always be called 'id'

We try to make the Okapi code exemplary, so that it would serve well as
an example for other module developers to emulate.


#### Core Okapi Web Service Authentication and Authorization

Access to the core services (all resources under the `/_/` path) is
granted to the Service Provider (SP) administrator, as the
functionality provided by those services spans multiple tenants. The
details of authentication and authorization of the SP administrators
are to be defined at a later stage and will most likely be provided by
an external module that can hook into a specific Service Provider
authentication system.

### Deployment and Discovery

Making a module available to a tenant is a multi-step process. It can be done
in a few different ways, but the most usual process is:

 * We POST a ModuleDescriptor to `/_/proxy` , telling Okapi that we know of
such module, what services it offers, and what it depends on.
 * We POST to `/_/discovery` that we want to have this module running on a
given node, and it will tell the deploy service on that node to start the
necessary processes.
 * We enable the module for a given tenant.

We assume some external management program will be making these requests.  It
can not be a proper Okapi module itself, because it needs to be running before
any modules have been deployed. For testing, see
the curl command-line [examples](#using-okapi) later in this document.

An alternative way is to not pass the Module ID to the Discovery, but to pass
a complete LaunchDescriptor. The ModuleDescriptor may not even have a
LaunchDescriptor in this case. This can be useful if running on a cluster where
the nodes are quite different, and you want to specify exactly where the files
are to be found. This is not the way we imagine Okapi clusters to run, but we
want to keep the option open.

Another alternative is to go to an even lower level, and POST the
LaunchDescriptor directly to the `/_/deployment` on any given node. This means
that the management software has to talk directly to individual nodes, which
raises all kind of questions about firewalls etc. But it allows full control,
which can be useful in some unusual clustering setups. Note that you still need
to post a ModuleDescriptor to `/_/proxy` to let Okapi know about the module, but
that the `/_/deployment` will inform `/_/discovery` of the existence of the
module it has deployed.

Of course, you do not have to use Okapi to manage deployments at all, you can
POST a DeploymentDescriptor to `/_/discovery` and give a URL instead of a
LaunchDescriptor. That tells Okapi where the service runs. It still needs a
Service ID to connect the URL to a ModuleDescriptor that you have POSTed
earlier. Unlike the previous examples, you need to provide a unique Instance Id
for `/_/discovery` to identify this instance of the module. This is necessary
because you can have the same module running on different URLs, presumably on
different nodes inside or external to your cluster. This method can be useful
if you make use of Okapi modules that exist outside your cluster, or if you use
some container system, perhaps a web server where your modules live as CGI
scripts at different URLs.

Note that the deployment and discovery stuff is transient, Okapi does not store
any of that in its database. If a node goes down, the processes on it will die
too. When it gets restarted, modules need to be deployed on it again, either via
Okapi, or through some other means.

The discovery data is kept in a shared map, so as long as there is one Okapi
running on the cluster, the map will survive. But if the whole cluster is taken
down, the discovery data is lost. It would be fairly useless at that point anyway.

In contrast, the ModuleDescriptors POSTed to `/_/proxy` are persisted in a database.


### Request Processing

Any number of modules can request registration on a single URI
path. Okapi will then forward the requests to those modules in an
order controlled by the integer-valued `level` setting in the module
registration configuration: modules with lower levels are processed
before those with higher levels.

Although Okapi accepts both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 requests, it uses HTTP 1.1 with
chunked encoding to make the connections to the modules.

We envision that different kinds of modules will carry different level
values: e.g. authentication and authorization will have the lowest
possible priority, next the actual business logic processing unit,
followed by metrics, statistics, monitoring, logging, etc.

The module metadata also controls how the request is forwarded to
consecutive modules in a pipeline and how the responses are
processed. Currently, we have three kinds of request processing by
modules (controlled by the `type` parameter in the module registration
configuration). The possible values are:

 * `headers` -- The module is interested in headers/parameters only,
and it can inspect them and perform an action based on the
presence/absence of headers/parameters and their corresponding
value. The module is not expected to return any entity in the
response, but only a status code to control the further chain of
execution or, in the case of an error, an immediate termination. The
module may return certain response headers that will be merged into
the complete response header list according to the header manipulation
rules below.

 * `request-only` -- The module is interested in the full client
request: header/parameters and the entity body attached to the
request. It does not produce a modified version or a new entity in the
response but performs an associated action and returns optional
headers and a status code to indicate further processing or
termination. In cases when an entity is returned, Okapi will discard
it and continue forwarding the original request body to the subsequent
modules in the pipeline.

 * `request-response` -- The module is interested in both
headers/parameters and the request body. It is also expected that the
module will return an entity in the response. This may be e.g. a
modified request body, in which case the module acts as a filter. The
returned response may then be forwarded on to the subsequent modules
as the new request body. Again, the chain of processing or termination
is controlled via the response status codes, and the response headers
are merged back into the complete response using the rules described
below.

* `redirect` -- The module does not serve this path directly, but redirects
the request to some other path, served by some other module. This is
intended as a mechanism for piling more complex modules on top of simpler
implementations, for example a module to edit and list users could be
extended by a module that manages users and passwords. It would have
actual code to handle creating and updating users, but could redirect
requests to list and get users to the simpler user module.

Most requests will likely be of type `request-response`, which is the
most powerful but potentially also most inefficient type, since it
requires content to be streamed to and from the module. Where more
efficient types can be used, they should be. For example, the
Authentication module's permission checking consults only the headers
of the request, and returns no body, so it is of type
`headers`. However, the same module's initial login request consults
the request body to determine the login parameters, and it also
returns a message; so it must be of type `request-response`.

Okapi has a feature where a module can exceptionally return a X-Okapi-Stop
header, and that will cause Okapi to terminate the pipeline with the result
this module returned. It is meant to be used sparingly, for example a module
in a login pipeline may conclude that the user is already authorized since
he comes from a IP address in the secure office, and abort the sequence of
events that would lead to a login screen being displayed.


### Status Codes

Continuation or termination of the pipeline is controlled by a status
code returned by an executed module. Standard [HTTP status
code](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) ranges
are accepted in Okapi:

 * 2xx range: OK return codes; if a code in this range is
returned by a module, Okapi continues execution of the pipeline and
forwards information to the consecutive modules according to the rules
described above. At the end of the chain, the status returned by the
last module invoked is the one returned to the caller.

 * 3xx range: Redirect codes. The pipeline is terminated, and the
response (including any `Location` header) is immediately returned
to the caller.

 * 4xx-5xx range: user request errors or internal system errors; if a
code in this range is returned by a module, Okapi immediately
terminates the entire chain and returns the code back to the caller.

### Header Merging Rules

Since Okapi forwards the response from a previous module on to the
next module in the pipeline (e.g. for additional filtering/processing),
certain initial request headers become invalid, e.g. when a
module converts the entity to a different content type or changes its
size. Invalid headers need to be updated, based on the module's
response header values, before the request can be forwarded to the
next module. At the same time Okapi also collects a set of response
headers in order to produce a final response that is sent back to the
original client when the processing pipeline completes.

Both sets of headers are modified according to the following rules:

 * Any headers that provide metadata about the request entity body
(e.g.  Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.) are merged from the last
response back into the request.

 * An additional set of special debug and monitoring headers is merged
from the last response into the current request (in order to forward
them to the next module).

 * A list of headers that provide metadata about the response entity
body is merged to the final response header set.

 * An additional set of special headers (debug, monitoring) or any
other headers that should be visible in the final response is merged
into the final response header set.

Okapi always adds a X-Okapi-Url header to the request to any modules.
This tells the modules how they can make further calls to Okapi, should
they need to. This Url can be specified on the command line when starting
Okapi, and it can well point to some load balancer in front of multiple
Okapi instances.

### Versioning and Dependencies

Modules can provide one or more interfaces, and can consume interfaces
provided by other modules. The interfaces have versions, and dependencies
can require given versions of an interface. Okapi will check dependencies and versions
whenever a module is deployed, and also when a module is enabled for a tenant.

Note that we can have multiple modules providing the same interface. These
can be deployed in Okapi simultaneously, but only one such module can be enabled
for any given tenant at a given time. For example, we can have two ways to
manage our patrons, one based on a local database, one talking to an external
system. The installation can know both, but each tenant must choose one or
the other.


#### Version numbers

We use a 3-part versioning scheme for module software versions, for example
`3.1.41` -- very much like [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
Interface versions consist only of the first two parts, as they have
no implementation version.

The first number is the major version. It needs to be incremented whenever
making a change that is not strictly backwards compatible, for example removing
functionality or changing semantics.

The second number is the minor version. It needs to be incremented whenever
backwards-compatible changes are made, for example adding new functionality
or optional fields.

The third number is the software version. It should be incremented on changes
that do not affect the interface, for example fixing bugs or improving
efficiency.

Although it is strongly recommended to use this versioning schema for all
modules, Okapi does not enforce it for modules. The reason is that Okapi does
not need to know anything about module versions -- it only worries about the
interfaces being compatible.

When checking interface versions, Okapi will require that the major version
number matches exactly what is required, and that the minor version is at least
as high as required.


If a module requires an interface 3.2, it will accept:
* 3.2 -- Same version
* 3.4 -- Higher minor version, compatible interfaces

But it will reject:
* 2.2 -- Lower major version
* 4.7 -- Higher major version
* 3.1 -- Lesser minor version

See further explanation of
[Version numbers](http://dev.folio.org/community/contrib-code#version-numbers).

### Security

Most of the security discussion has been moved into its own document,
[Okapi Security Model](security.md).
This chapter of this Okapi Guide just provides a quick overview.

The security model is concerned about three things:
* Authentication -- That we know who the user is.
* Authorization -- That the user is allowed to make this request.
* Permissions -- Mapping from user roles all the way down to detailed permissions
Most of this work has been delegated to modules, so Okapi itself will not have
to do so much work. But it still needs to orchestrate the whole operation.

Ignoring all the messy details, this how it works: The client (often on a web
browser, but can really be anything) calls the `/login` service to identify
itself. Depending on the tenant, we may have different authorization modules
serving the /login request, and they may take different parameters (username
and password are the most likely, but we can have anything from simple IP
authentication to complex interactions with LDAP, OAuth, or other systems).

The authorization service returns a token to the client, and the client passes
this token in a special header in all requests it makes to Okapi. Okapi in turn
passes it to the authorization module, together with information of what modules
will be called to satisfy the request, and what permissions those modules require
and desire, and if they have special module level permissions. The authorization
service checks the permissions. If required permissions are not there, the whole
request is denied. If all is well, the module returns information about the
desired permissions, and possibly special tokens to be passed to some modules.

Okapi passes the request to each module in the pipeline in turn. Each of them
get information of the desired permissions, so they can alter the behavior as
needed, and a token that they can use for further calls.

The trivial okapi-test-auth-module module included in the Okapi source tree does
not implement much of this scheme. It is there just to help us test the parts
that Okapi needs to handle.

### Open Issues

#### Caching

Okapi can provide an additional caching layer between modules,
especially in busy, read-heavy, multi-module pipelines. We plan to
follow standard HTTP mechanisms and semantics in this respect, and
implementation details will be established within the coming months.

#### Instrumentation and Analytics

In a microservices architecture, monitoring is key to ensure robustness
and health of the entire system. The way to provide useful monitoring
is to include well-defined instrumentation points ("hooks") before and
after each step of execution of the request processing
pipeline. Besides monitoring, instrumentation is crucial for the
ability to quickly diagnose issues in the running system ("hot"
debugging) and discovering performance bottlenecks (profiling). We are
looking at established solutions in this regard: e.g. JMX,
Dropwizard Metrics, Graphite, etc.

A multi-module system may provide a wide variety of metrics and an
immense amount of measurement data. Only a fraction of this data can
be analyzed at runtime, most of it must be captured for analysis at a
later stage. Capturing and storing data in a form that lends itself to
an effortless post factum analysis is essential for analytics and we
are looking into integration between open and popular solutions and
Okapi.

#### Response Aggregation

There is no direct support for response aggregation in Okapi at the
moment, as Okapi assumes sequential execution of the pipeline and
forwards each response to the next module in the pipeline. In this
mode, it is entirely possible to implement an aggregation module that
will communicate with multiple modules (via Okapi, to retain the
provided authentication and service discovery) and combine the
responses. In further releases a more generic approach to response
aggregation will be evaluated.

#### Asynchronous messaging

At present, Okapi assumes and implements HTTP as the transport
protocol between modules, both on the front-end and within the
system. HTTP is based on a request-response paradigm and does not
directly include asynchronous messaging capabilities.  It is, however,
entirely possible to model an asynchronous mode of operation on top of
HTTP, e.g. using a polling approach or HTTP extensions like
websockets. We anticipate that for future releases of Okapi we will
investigate the asynchronous approach in depth and provide support for
some open messaging protocols (e.g. STOMP).

## Implementation

We have a rudimentary implementation of Okapi in place. The examples below
are supposed to work with the current implementation.

### Missing features

 Nothing major, at this point.

## Compiling and Running

The latest source of the software can be found at
[GitHub](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi).

The build requirements are:

 * Apache Maven 3.3.1 or later.
 * Java 8 JDK
 * [Git](https://git-scm.com)

With these available, build with:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/folio-org/okapi.git
cd okapi
mvn install
```

The install rule also runs a few tests. Tests should not fail.
If they do, please report it and in the meantime fall back to:

```
mvn install -DskipTests
```

If successful, the output of `mvn install` should have this line near
the end:

```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

The okapi directory contains a few sub modules. These are:

 * `okapi-core` -- The gateway server itself.
 * `okapi-common` -- Utilities used by both gateway and modules.
 * `doc` -- Documentation, including this guide.
 * `okapi-test-auth-module` -- A simple module for testing authentication stuff.
 * `okapi-test-module` -- A module mangling HTTP content for test purposes.
 * `okapi-test-header-module` -- A module to test headers-only mode.

(Note the build order specified in the `pom.xml`:
okapi-core must be last because its tests rely on the previous ones.)

The result for each module and okapi-core is a combined jar file
with all necessary components combined, including Vert.x. The listening
port is adjusted with property `port`.

For example, to run the okapi-test-auth-module module and listen on port 8600, use:

```
cd okapi-test-auth-module
java -Dport=8600 -jar target/okapi-test-auth-module-fat.jar
```

In the same way, to run the okapi-core, specify its jar file. It is
also necessary to provide a further command-line argument: a command
telling okapi-core what mode to run in. When playing with okapi on a
single node, we use the `dev` mode.

```
cd okapi-core
java -Dport=8600 -jar target/okapi-core-fat.jar dev
```

There are other commands available. Supply `help` to get a description of
these.

A Maven rule to run the gateway is provided as part of the `pom.xml`,
in the main directory.

```
mvn exec:exec
```
This will start the okapi-core and make it listen on its default port: 9130.

For remote debugging you can use
```
mvn exec:exec@debug
```
This command requires Maven >= 3.3.1. It will listen for a
debugging client on port 5005.

## Using Okapi

These examples show how to use Okapi from the command line, using the `curl`
http client. You should be able to copy and paste the commands to your
command line from this document.

The exact definition of the services is in the RAML files listed in
the [Reference](#web-service) section.

### Storage

Okapi defaults to an internal in-memory mock storage, so it can run without
any database layer under it. This is fine for development and testing, but of
course in real life we will want some of our data to persist from one invocation
to the next. At the moment, MongoDB and PostgreSQL storage can be enabled by
option `-Dstorage=mongo` and  `-Dstorage=postgres` respectively to the command
line that starts Okapi.

PostgreSQL requires some tables and indexes to be created. This can be done with
the command initdatabase, for example
```
java -Dport=8600 -Dstorage=postgres -jar target/okapi-core-fat.jar initdatabase
```
This command creates the necessary stuff, and exits Okapi. If you want to clear
things up, you can use the command `purgedatabase`.

The Mongo backend does not respect these commands, and the in-memory backed has
no need for them.

### Curl examples

The examples in the following sections can be pasted into a command-line console.

It is also possible to extract all the example records with a perl
one-liner, assuming you have this MarkDown source of this guide in the
current directory as _guide.md_ -- as is the case in the source tree.
This leaves them all in /tmp, as files like `okapi-tenant.json`
```
perl -n -e 'print if /^cat /../^END/;' guide.md | sh
```

After that, it is also possible to run all the examples with a slightly more
complex command:

```
perl -n -e 'print if /^curl /../http/; ' guide.md |
  grep -v 8080 | grep -v DELETE |
  sh -x
```

(See the script `doc/okapi-examples.sh` which runs the above two commands.)

This explicitly omits the cleaning up DELETE commands, so it leaves Okapi in a
well-defined state with a few modules enabled for a few known tenants.

### Example modules

Okapi is all about invoking modules, so we need to have a few to play with.
It comes with three dummy modules that demonstrate different things.

Note that these are only intended for demonstration and test purposes.
Do not base any real modules on these.

There are additional modules in the separate repository
[folio-sample-modules](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-sample-modules).

#### Okapi-test-module

This is a very simple module. If you make a GET request to it, it will reply "It
works". If you POST something to it, it will reply with "Hello" followed by
whatever you posted. It can do a few other tricks too, like echoing request
headers. These are used in the tests for okapi-core.

Normally Okapi will be starting and stopping these modules for you, but we will
run this one directly for now -- mostly to see how to use curl, a
command-line HTTP client that is useful for testing.

Open a console window, navigate to the okapi project root and issue the command:

```
java -jar okapi-test-module/target/okapi-test-module-fat.jar
```

This starts the okapi-test-module listening on port 8080.

Now open another console window, and try to access the
test module with:

```
curl -w '\n' http://localhost:8080/testb
```

It should tell you that it works.

The option "`-w '\n'`" is just to make curl output an extra newline,
because the responses do not necessarily end in newlines.

Now we will try to POST something to the test module. In real life this
would be a JSON structure, but for now a simple text string will do.

```
echo "Testing Okapi" > okapi.txt
curl -w '\n' -X POST -d @okapi.txt http://localhost:8080/testb
```

Again we have the -w option to get a newline in the output, and this
time we add `-X POST` to make it a post request, and `-d @okapi.txt`
to specify the name of the file containing the data that we want to
post.

The test module should respond with

    Hello Testing Okapi

which is our test data, with a "Hello" prepended to it.

That is enough about the okapi-test-module for now. Go back to the window
where you left it running, and kill it with a `Ctrl-C` command. It should
not have produced any output after the initial messages.

#### Okapi-test-header-module

The `test-header` module demonstrates the use of a type=headers module; that is
a module which inspects HTTP headers and produces a new set of HTTP headers.
The response body is ignored and should be empty.

Start with:

```
java -jar okapi-test-header-module/target/okapi-test-header-module-fat.jar
```

The module reads `X-my-header` from leading path `/testb`. If that header is
present, it will take its value and append `,foo`.
If no such header is present, it will use the value `foo`.

These two cases can be demonstrated with:

```
curl -w '\n' -D- http://localhost:8080/testb
```
and
```
curl -w '\n' -H "X-my-header:hey" -D- http://localhost:8080/testb
```

As above, now stop that simple verification.

#### Okapi-test-auth-module

Okapi itself does not do authentication: it delegates that to a
module.  We do not have a fully functional authentication module yet,
but we have a dummy module that can be used to demonstrate how it
works. Also this one is mostly used for testing the auth mechanisms in
Okapi itself.

The dummy module supports two functions: `/login` is, as its name implies,
a login function that takes a username and password, and if acceptable,
returns a token in a HTTP header. Any other path goes through the check
function that checks that we have a valid token in the HTTP request
headers.

We will see examples of this when we get to play with Okapi itself. If
you want, you can verify the module directly as with the okapi-test-module.

### Running Okapi itself

Now we are ready to start Okapi.
Note: for this example to work it is important that the current directory
of the Okapi is the top-level directory `.../okapi`.

```
java -jar okapi-core/target/okapi-core-fat.jar dev
```

The `dev` command tells to run it in development mode, which makes it start
with a known clean state without any modules or tenants defined.

Okapi lists its PID (process ID) and says `API Gateway started`.
That means it is running, and listening on the default port
which happens to be 9130, and using in-memory storage. (To use MongoDB
storage instead, add `-Dstorage=mongo` to the command line.)

At the moment Okapi does not know of any module or tenant. But it does
have its own web services enabled. We can verify both by asking Okapi
to list modules and tenants.
```
curl -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules
curl -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants
```
Both of these return lists in the form of JSON structures. At present,
because we have just started running, it is an empty list in both
cases:

```
[ ]
```

### Example 1: Deploying and using a simple module

So we need to tell Okapi that we want to work with some modules. In real life
these operations would be carried out by a properly authorized administrator.

As mentioned above, the process consists of three parts: deployment, discovery,
and configuring the proxying.

#### Deploying the test-basic module

To tell Okapi that we want to use the `okapi-test-module`, we create a JSON
structure of a moduleDescriptor and POST it to Okapi:

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-proxy-test-basic.1.json <<END
{
  "id": "test-basic-1.0.0",
  "name": "Okapi test module",
  "provides": [
    {
      "id": "test-basic",
      "version": "2.2",
      "handlers": [
        {
          "methods": [ "GET", "POST" ],
          "pathPattern": "/testb"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "launchDescriptor": {
    "exec": "java -Dport=%p -jar okapi-test-module/target/okapi-test-module-fat.jar"
  }
}
END
```

The id is what we will be using to refer to this module later. The version number
is included in the id, so that the id uniquely identifies exactly what module
we are talking about. (Okapi does not enforce this, it is also possible to use
UUIDs or other things, as long as they are truly unique.)

This module provides just one interface, called `test-basic`. It has one handler
that indicates that the interface is interested in GET and POST requests to the
/testb path and nothing else.

The launchDescriptor tells Okapi how this module is to be started and stopped.
In this version we use a simple `exec` command line. Okapi will start a process,
remember the PID, and just kill it when we are done.

The moduleDescriptor can contain much more stuff, more about that in later
examples.

So, let's post it:
```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-proxy-test-basic.1.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/proxy/modules/test-basic-1.0.0
Content-Length: 350

{
  "id" : "test-basic-1.0.0",
  "name" : "Okapi test module",
  "provides" : [ {
    "id" : "test-basic",
    "version" : "2.2",
    "handlers" : [ {
      "methods" : [ "GET", "POST" ],
      "pathPattern" : "/testb"
    } ]
  } ],
  "launchDescriptor" : {
    "exec" : "java -Dport=%p -jar okapi-test-module/target/okapi-test-module-fat.jar"
  }
}
```

Okapi responds with a "201 Created", and reports back the same JSON. There is
also a Location header that shows the address of this module, if we want to
modify or delete it, or just look at it, like this:

```
curl -w '\n' -D - http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules/test-basic-1.0.0
```

We can also ask Okapi to list all known modules, like we did in the beginning:
```
curl -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules
```
Note that Okapi gives us less details about the modules, for in the real life this
could be quite a long list.

#### Deploying the module

It is not enough that Okapi knows that such a module exists. We must also
deploy the module. Here we must note that Okapi is meant to be running on a
cluster with many nodes, so we must decide on which one to deploy it.  First we
must check what clusters we have to work with:

```
curl -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/nodes
```

Okapi responds with a short list of only one node:

```
[ {
  "nodeId" : "localhost",
  "url" : "http://localhost:9130"
} ]
```

This is not surprising, we are running the whole thing on one machine, in 'dev'
mode, so we only have one node in the cluster and by default it is called
'localhost'.  If this was a real cluster, the cluster manager would have given
ugly UUIDs for all the nodes when they started up. So let's deploy it there.
First we create a DeploymentDescriptor:

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-deploy-test-basic.1.json <<END
{
  "srvcId": "test-basic-1.0.0",
  "nodeId": "localhost"
}
END
```

And then we POST it to `/_/discovery`. Note that we do not post to
`/_/deployment` although we could do so. The difference is that for `deployment`
we would need to post to the actual node, whereas discovery is responsible for
knowing what runs on which node, and is available on any Okapi on the cluster.
In a production system there would probably be a firewall preventing any direct
access to the nodes.

```
curl -w '\n' -D - -s \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-deploy-test-basic.1.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules
```

Okapi responds with
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/discovery/modules/test-basic-1.0.0/localhost-9131
Content-Length: 237

{
  "instId" : "localhost-9131",
  "srvcId" : "test-basic-1.0.0",
  "nodeId" : "localhost",
  "url" : "http://localhost:9131",
  "descriptor" : {
    "exec" : "java -Dport=%p -jar okapi-test-module/target/okapi-test-module-fat.jar"
  }
}
```

There is a bit more detail than what we posted to it. We only gave it the
service Id "test-basic-1.0.0", and it went ahead and looked up the
LaunchDescriptor from the ModuleDescriptor we posted earlier, with this id.

Okapi has also allocated a port for this module, 9131, and given it an instance
ID, "localhost-9131". This is necessary, since we can have multiple instances
of the same module running on different nodes, or even the same one.

Finally Okapi also returns the URL that the module is listening on. In a real life
cluster there would be a firewall preventing any direct access to the modules,
since all traffic must go through Okapi for authorization checks, logging, etc.
But in our simple test example, we can verify that the module is actually
running on that URL. Well, not exactly that URL, but a URL that we get when
we combine the path from the handler with the base URL above:
```
curl -w '\n' http://localhost:9131/testb

It works
```

#### Creating a tenant
As noted above, all traffic should be going through Okapi, not directly
to the modules. But if we try Okapi's own base URL we get:

```
curl -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/testb

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 14

Missing Tenant
```

Okapi is a multi-tenant system, so each request must be done on behalf of some
tenant. And we have not even created any tenants yet. Let's do that now. It is
not very difficult:

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-tenant.json <<END
{
  "id": "testlib",
  "name": "Test Library",
  "description": "Our Own Test Library"
}
END

curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-tenant.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/proxy/tenants/testlib
Content-Length: 91

{
  "id" : "testlib",
  "name" : "Test Library",
  "description" : "Our Own Test Library"
}
```

#### Enabling the module for our tenant
Next we need to enable the module for our tenant. This is even simpler operation:

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-enable-basic-1.json <<END
{
  "id": "test-basic-1.0.0"
}
END

curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-enable-basic-1.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules/test-basic-1.0.0
Content-Length: 31

{
  "id" : "test-basic-1.0.0"
}
```

#### Calling the module

So, now we have a tenant, and it has a module enabled. Last time we tried to
call the module, Okapi responded with "Missing tenant". We need to add the
tenant in our calls, as an extra header:

```
curl -D - -w '\n' \
  -H "X-Okapi-Tenant: testlib" \
  http://localhost:9130/testb

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
X-Okapi-Trace: GET - Okapi test module http://localhost:9131/testb : 200 11152us
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

It works
```

### Example 2: Adding the Auth module

The previous example works for anyone who can guess a tenant ID. That is fine
for a small test module, but real life modules do real work, and need to be
restricted to privileged users. In real life we would have a complex set of
modules managing all kind of authentication and authorization stuff, but for
this example we only have Okapi's own test-auth module to play with. It will
not do any serious authentication, but will be just enough to demonstrate how
to use one.

As before, the first thing we create is a ModuleDescriptor:
```
cat > /tmp/okapi-module-auth.json <<END
{
  "id": "test-auth",
  "name": "Okapi test auth module",
  "provides": [
    {
      "id": "test-auth",
      "version": "3.4",
      "handlers": [
        {
          "methods": [ "POST" ],
          "pathPattern": "/login"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "filters": [
    {
      "methods": [ "*" ],
      "pathPattern": "/*",
      "phase": "auth",
      "type": "headers"
    }
  ]
}
END
```
The module has one handler, for the /login path. It also has a filter that
connects with every incoming request. That is where it decides if the user will
be allowed to make the request. This one has a type "headers", which means that
Okapi does not pass the whole request to it, just the headers.


The pathPattern for the filter uses the wildcard character (`*`) to match any path.
A pathPattern may also include curly braces pairs to match a path component. For
example `/users/{id}` would match `/users/abc`, but not `/users/abc/d`.

We could have included a launchDescriptor as before, but just to demonstrate
another way, we have omitted it here. Doing it this way may make more sense in
a clustered environment where each module instance may need some extra
command-line arguments or environment variables.

So we POST it to Okapi:

```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-module-auth.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/proxy/modules/test-auth
Content-Length: 345

{
  "id" : "test-auth",
  "name" : "Okapi test auth module",
  "provides" : [ {
    "id" : "test-auth",
    "version" : "3.4",
    "handlers" : [ {
      "methods" : [ "POST" ],
      "pathPattern" : "/login"
    } ]
  } ],
  "filters" : [ {
    "methods" : [ "*" ],
    "pathPattern" : "/*",
    "phase" : "auth",
    "type" : "headers"
  } ]
}
```

Next we need to deploy the module. Since we did not put a launchDescriptor
in the moduleDescriptor, we need to provide one here.

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-deploy-test-auth.json <<END
{
  "srvcId": "test-auth",
  "nodeId": "localhost",
  "descriptor": {
    "exec": "java -Dport=%p -jar okapi-test-auth-module/target/okapi-test-auth-module-fat.jar"
  }
}
END

curl -w '\n' -D - -s \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-deploy-test-auth.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/discovery/modules/test-auth/localhost-9132
Content-Length: 240

{
  "instId" : "localhost-9132",
  "srvcId" : "test-auth",
  "nodeId" : "localhost",
  "url" : "http://localhost:9132",
  "descriptor" : {
    "exec" : "java -Dport=%p -jar okapi-test-auth-module/target/okapi-test-auth-module-fat.jar"
  }
}

```

And we enable the module for our tenant:

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-enable-auth.json <<END
{
  "id": "test-auth"
}
END

curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-enable-auth.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules/test-auth
Content-Length: 24

{
  "id" : "test-auth"
}
```

So, the auth module should now intercept every call we make to Okapi, and
check if we are authorized for it. Let's try with the same call to the
basic module as before:

```
curl -D - -w '\n' \
  -H "X-Okapi-Tenant: testlib" \
  http://localhost:9130/testb

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: text/plain
X-Okapi-Trace: GET - Okapi test auth module http://localhost:9132/testb : 401 68987us
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Auth.check called without X-Okapi-Token
```

Indeed, we are no longer allowed to call the test module. So, how do we get
the permission? The error message says that we need a `X-Okapi-Token`. Those
we can get from the login service. The dummy auth module is not very clever in
verifying passwords, it assumes that for username "peter" we have a password
"peter-password". Not overly secure, but enough for this example.

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-login.json <<END
{
  "tenant": "testlib",
  "username": "peter",
  "password": "peter-password"
}
END

curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Okapi-Tenant: testlib" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-login.json \
  http://localhost:9130/login

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Okapi-Token: dummyJwt.eyJzdWIiOiJwZXRlciIsInRlbmFudCI6InRlc3RsaWIifQ==.sig
X-Okapi-Trace: POST - Okapi test auth module http://localhost:9132/login : 200 159251us
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{  "tenant": "testlib",  "username": "peter",  "password": "peter-password"}
```

The response just echoes its parameters, but notice that we get back a header
`X-Okapi-Token: dummyJwt.eyJzdWIiOiJwZXRlciIsInRlbmFudCI6InRlc3RsaWIifQ==.sig`.
We are not supposed to worry about what that header contains, but we can see its
format is almost as you would expect from a JWT: Three parts separated by dots,
first a header, then a base-64 encoded payload, and finally a signature. The
header and signature would normally be base-64 encoded as well, but the simple
test-auth module skips that part, to make a distinct token that can not be mistaken
as a real JWT. The payload is indeed base-64 encoded, and if you decode it, you
see that it will contain a JSON structure with the user id and the tenant id,
and nothing much else. A real-life auth module would of course put more stuff
in the JWT, and sign it with some strong crypto. But that should make no
difference to Okapi's users -- all that they need to know is how do we get a token,
and how to pass it on in every request. Like this:

```
curl -D - -w '\n' \
  -H "X-Okapi-Tenant: testlib" \
  -H "X-Okapi-Token: dummyJwt.eyJzdWIiOiJwZXRlciIsInRlbmFudCI6InRlc3RsaWIifQ==.sig" \
  http://localhost:9130/testb

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
X-Okapi-Trace: GET - Okapi test module http://localhost:9131/testb : 200 1567us
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

It works
```

We can also post things to our test module:
```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Okapi-Tenant: testlib" \
  -H "X-Okapi-Token: dummyJwt.eyJzdWIiOiJwZXRlciIsInRlbmFudCI6InRlc3RsaWIifQ==.sig" \
  -d '{ "foo":"bar"}' \
  http://localhost:9130/testb
```
The module responds with the same JSON, but prepends "Hello" to the string.


### Example 3: Upgrading, versions, environment, and the `_tenant` interface

Upgrading can often be problematic. More so in Okapi, since we are serving many
tenants, who will have different ideas about when and what to upgrade. In this
example we go through the upgrading process, discuss versions, environment
variables, and also look at the special `_tenant` system interface.

Let's say we have a new and improved sample module:
```
cat > /tmp/okapi-proxy-test-basic.2.json <<END
{
  "id": "test-basic-1.2.0",
  "name": "Okapi test module, improved",
  "provides": [
    {
      "id": "test-basic",
      "version": "2.4",
      "handlers": [
        {
          "methods": [ "GET", "POST" ],
          "pathPattern": "/testb"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "_tenant",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "interfaceType": "system",
      "handlers": [
        {
          "methods": [ "POST" ],
          "pathPattern": "/_/tenant"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "requires": [
    {
      "id": "test-auth",
      "version": "3.1"
    }
  ],
  "launchDescriptor": {
    "exec": "java -Dport=%p -jar okapi-test-module/target/okapi-test-module-fat.jar",
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "helloGreeting",
        "value": "Hi there"
      }
    ]
  }
}
END
```
Note that we give it a different id, with the same name, but a higher version
number. Note also that for this example we make use of the same okapi-test-module
program, since we do not have much else to play with. This could also happen in
real life, if we only have changes in the module descriptor, like we have here.

We have added a new interface that the module supports: `_tenant`. It is a
system interface that Okapi will automatically call when the module gets
enabled for a tenant. Its purpose is to do whatever initialization the module
needs, for example to create database tables.

We have also specified that this module requires the test-auth interface at least
in version 3.1. The auth module we installed in the previous example provides
3.4, so it is good enough.  (Requiring 3.5 or 4.0, or even 2.0 would not work,
see [_Versioning and Dependencies_](#versioning-and-dependencies) or edit the
descriptor and try to post it).

Finally we have added an environment variable in the launch descriptor that
specifies a different greeting. The module should report that back when
serving a POST request.

The upgrade process starts by posting the new module descriptor, just like with
any module. We can not touch the old one, since some tenants may be using it.

```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-proxy-test-basic.2.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules

HTTP/1.1 201 Created   ...
```
Next we deploy the module, just as before.

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-deploy-test-basic.2.json <<END
{
  "srvcId": "test-basic-1.2.0",
  "nodeId": "localhost"
}
END

curl -w '\n' -D - -s \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-deploy-test-basic.2.json  \
  http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules
```

Now we have both modules installed and running. Our tenant is still using the
old one. Let's change that, by enabling the new one instead of the old one.
This is done with a POST request to the URL of the current module.

```
cat > /tmp/okapi-enable-basic-2.json <<END
{
  "id": "test-basic-1.2.0"
}
END

curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/okapi-enable-basic-2.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules/test-basic-1.0.0

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules/test-basic-1.0.0/test-basic-1.2.0
Content-Length: 31

{
  "id" : "test-basic-1.2.0"
}

```

Now the new module is enabled for our tenant, and the old one is not, as can
be seen with:
```
curl -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules
```

If you look at Okapi's log, you see there is a line like this:
```
15:32:40 INFO  MainVerticle         POST request to okapi-test-module tenant service for tenant testlib
```

It shows that our test module did get a request to the tenant interface.

In order to verify that we really are using the new module, let's post a thing
to it:
```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \

Indeed, we see "Hi there" instead of "Hello", and the X-Okapi-Trace shows that
the request was sent to the improved version of the module.

### Example 4: Complete ModuleDescriptor

In this example we just show you a complete ModuleDescriptor, with all the bells
and whistles. By now you should know how to use one, so there is no need to
repeat all the `curl` commands.

      ]
    },

      "description": "See, Update or create a record, including sensitive stuff",
      "subPermissions": [
        "test-basic.view",
        "test-basic.update",
        " test-basic.get.sensitive.details"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "launchDescriptor": {
    "exec": "java -Dport=%p -jar okapi-test-module/target/okapi-test-module-fat.jar",
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "helloGreeting",
        "value": "Hi there"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Most of the descriptor should look quite familiar at this point. The big
new thing is about permissions.
The full [permission system](security.md) is explained in a separate
document and managed by the auth module complex.
All of that is outside the scope of Okapi itself, and of this guide.

The most visible new thing in this descriptor is the whole new section called
permissionSets. This defines what permissions and permission sets this module
cares about. Point of terminology: "Permissions", or "Permission Bits" are
simple strings like "test-basic.get.list". Okapi and the auth module operate
on this granular level. "Permission Sets" are named sets that can contain
several permission bits, and even other sets. Those will be reduced to the
actual bits by the auth module. These are the lowest level that an admin user
normally sees, and form the building blocks for constructing more complex roles.

The permission bits are used in the handler entries. The first one has a
permissionsRequired field that contains the permission "test-basic.get.list".
That means that if the user does not have such a permission, the auth module
tells Okapi, which will refuse the request.

The next entry has a permissionsRequired too, but also a permissionsDesired
field with "test-basic.get.sensitive.details" in it. That indicates that the
module desires to know if the user has such a permission or not. It is not a
hard requirement, the request will be passed to the module in any case, but
there will be a X-Okapi-Permissions header that will or will not contain
that permission name. It is up to the module to decide what to do with it,
in this case it could well decide to show or hide some unusually sensitive
fields.

There is also a third field, "modulePermissions" with the value "config.lookup".
This tells that our module has been granted this permission. Even if the user
will not have such a permission, the module does, and is therefore allowed to
do something like looking up the configuration settings.

As noted above, Okapi operates with the raw permission bits. It passed the
required and desired permissions to the auth module, which will somehow
deduce if the user will have those permissions or not. The details should not
concern us here, but clearly the process has something to do with the
permissionSets. How does the auth module get access to the permission sets of
the moduleDescription? It does not happen by magic, but almost. When a module
gets enabled for a tenant, Okapi not only calls the `_tenant` interface of the
module itself, but also sees if any module provides a tenantPermissions
interface, and passes the permissionSets there. The permission module is
supposed to do that, and receive the permissionSets that way.

Even this example does not cover all the possibilities in a ModuleDescriptor.
There are features lingering from older versions (older than Okapi 1.2.0) that
are still supported, but will be deprecated and removed in future versions.
For example ModulePermissions and RoutingEntries on the top level of the
descriptor. For the fully up-to-date definition, you should always refer to
the RAML and JSON schemas in the [Reference](#web-service) section.

#### Cleaning up
We are done with the examples. Just to be nice, we delete everything we have
installed:

```
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules/test-basic-1.2.0
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/testlib/modules/test-auth
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/testlib
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules/test-auth/localhost-9132
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules/test-basic-1.0.0/localhost-9131
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules/test-basic-1.2.0/localhost-9133
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules/test-basic-1.0.0
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules/test-basic-1.2.0
curl -X DELETE -D - -w '\n' http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules/test-auth
```

Okapi responds to each of these with a simple:

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 0
```

Finally we can stop the Okapi instance we had running, with a simple `Ctrl-C`
command.

## Reference

### Okapi program

The Okapi program is shipped as a bundled jar (okapi-core-fat.jar). The
general invocation is:

  `java` [*java-options*] `-jar path/okapi-core-fat.jar` *command* [*options*]

This is a standard Java command line. Of particular interest is
java-option `-D` which may set properties for the program: see below
for relevant properties. Okapi itself parses *command* and any
*options* that follow.

#### Java -D options

The `-D` option can be used to specify various run-time parameters in
Okapi. These must be at the beginning of the command line, before the
`-jar`.

* `port`: The port on which Okapi listens. Defaults to 9130
* `port_start` and `port_end`: The range of ports for modules. Default to
`port`+1 to `port`+10, normally 9131 to 9141
* `host`: Hostname to be used in the URLs returned by the deployment service.
Defaults to `localhost`
* `storage`: Defines the storage back end, `postgres`, `mongo` or (the default)
`inmemory`
* `loglevel`: The logging level. Defaults to `INFO`; other useful values are
`DEBUG`, `TRACE`, `WARN` and `ERROR`.
* `okapiurl`: Tells Okapi its own official URL. This gets passed to the modules
as X-Okapi-Url header, and the modules can use this to make further requests
to Okapi. Defaults to `http://localhost:9130` or what ever port specified. There
should be no trailing slash, but if there happens to be one, Okapi will remove it.
* `dockerUrl`: Tells the Okapi deployment where the Docker Daemon is. Defaults to
`http://localhost:4243`.
* `postgres_host` : PostgreSQL host. Defaults to `localhost`.
* `postgres_port` : PostgreSQL port. Defaults to 5432.
* `postgres_username` : PostgreSQL username. Defaults to `okapi`.
* `postgres_password`: PostgreSQL password. Defaults to `okapi25`.
* `postgres_database`: PostgreSQL database. Defaults to `okapi`.
* `postgres_db_init`: For a value of `1`, Okapi will drop existing PostgreSQL
database and prepare a new one. A value of `0` (null) will leave it unmodified
(default).

#### Command

Okapi requires exactly one command to be given. These are:
* `cluster` for running in clustered mode/production
* `dev` for running in development, single-node mode
* `deployment` for deployment only. Clustered mode
* `proxy` for proxy + discovery. Clustered mode
* `help` to list command-line options and commands

#### Command-line options

These options are at the end of the command line:

* `-hazelcast-config-cp` _file_ -- Read config from class path
* `-hazelcast-config-file` _file_ -- Read config from local file
* `-hazelcast-config-url` _url_ -- Read config from URL
* `-enable-metrics` -- Enables the sending of various metrics to a Carbon back
end.
* `-cluster-host` _ip_ -- Vertx cluster host
* `-cluster-port` _port_ -- Vertx cluster port


### Environment Variables

Okapi offers a concept: environment variables. These are system-wide
properties and provides a way to pass information to modules
during deployment. For example, a module that accesses a database
will need to know the connection details.

At deployment the environment variables are defined for the
process to be deployed. Note that those can only be passed to modules
that Okapi manages, e.g. Docker instances and processes. But not
remote services defined by a URL (which are not deployed anyway).

For everything but the deployment-mode, Okapi provides CRU service under
`/_/env`. The identifier for the service is the name of the variable. It
must not include a slash and may not begin with underscore.
An environment entity is defined by
[`EnvEntry.json`](../okapi-core/src/main/raml/EnvEntry.json).

### Web Service

The Okapi service requests (all those prefixed with `/_/`) are specified
in the [RAML](http://raml.org/) syntax.

  * The top-level file, [okapi.raml](../okapi-core/src/main/raml/okapi.raml)
  * [Directory of RAML and included JSON Schema files](../okapi-core/src/main/raml)
  * [API reference documentation](http://dev.folio.org/doc/api/) generated from those files

### Deployment

Deployment is specified by schemas
[DeploymentDescriptor.json](../okapi-core/src/main/raml/DeploymentDescriptor.json)
and [LaunchDescriptor.json](../okapi-core/src/main/raml/LaunchDescriptor.json). The
LaunchDescriptor can be part of a ModuleDescriptor, or it can be specified in a
DeploymentDescriptor.

The following methods exist for launching modules:

* Process: The `exec` property specifies a process that stays alive and is
killed (by signal) by Okapi itself.

* Commands: Triggered by presence of `cmdlineStart` and `cmdlineStop`
properties. The `cmdlineStart` is a shell script that spawns and puts
a service in the background. The `cmdlineStop` is a shell script that
terminates the corresponding service.

* Docker: The `dockerImage` property specifies an existing
image. Okapi manages a container based on this image. This option
requires that the `dockerUrl` points to a Docker Daemon accessible via
HTTP. The Dockerfile's `CMD` directive may be changed with property
`dockerCMD`. This assumes that `ENTRYPOINT` is the full invocation of
the module and that `CMD` is either default settings or, preferably,
empty. Finally, the property `dockerArgs` may be used to pass
Docker SDK create-container arguments. This is an object with keys
such as `Hostname`, `DomainName`, `User`, `AttachStdin`, ... See
for example, the [v1.26 API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.26).


For all deployment types, environment variables may be passed via the
`env` property. This takes an array of objects specifying each
environment variable. Each object has property `name` and `value` for
environment variable name and value respectively.

When launching a module, a TCP listening port is assigned. The module
should be listening on that port after successful deployment (serving
HTTP requests).  The port is passed as `%p` in the value of properties
`exec` and `cmdlineStart`. For Docker deployment, Okapi will map the
exposed port (`EXPOSE`) to the dynamically assigned port.

It is also possible to refer to an already-launched process (maybe running in your
development IDE), by POSTing a DeploymentDescriptor to `/_/discovery`, with no nodeId
and no LaunchDescriptor, but with the URL where the module is running.

### Docker

Okapi uses the [Docker Engine API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/) for
launching modules. The Docker daemon must be listening on a TCP port in
order for that to work because Okapi does not deal with HTTP over Unix local
socket. Enabling that for the Docker daemon depends on the host system.
For systemd based systems, the `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` must be
adjusted and the `ExecStart` line should include the `-H` option with a tcp
listening host+port. For example `-H tcp://127.0.0.1:4243` .

```
vi /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker
```

### System Interfaces

Modules can provide system interfaces, and Okapi can make requests to those in
some well defined situations. By convention these interfaces have names that
start with an underscore.

At the moment we have two system interfaces defined, but in time we may get
a few more.

#### Tenant Interface

If a module provides a system interface called `_tenant`, Okapi invokes that
interface every time a module gets enabled for a tenant. The request contains
information about the newly enabled module, and optionally of some module that
got disabled at the same time, for example when a module is being upgraded. The
module can use this information to upgrade or initialize its database, and do
any kind of housekeeping it needs.

For the [specifics](#web-service), see under `.../okapi/okapi-core/src/main/raml/raml-util`
the files `ramls/tenant.raml` and `schemas/moduleInfo.schema`.
The okapi-test-module
has a very trivial implementation of this, and the moduleTest shows a module
Descriptor that defines this interface.

The tenant interface was introduced in version 1.0

#### TenantPermissions Interface

When a module gets enabled for a tenant, Okapi also attempts to locate a
module that provides the `_tenantPermissions` interface, and invoke that.
Typically this would be provided by the permission module. It gets a structure
that contains the module to be enabled, and all the permissionSets from the
moduleDescriptor. The purpose of this is to load the permissions and permission
sets into the permission module, so that they can be assigned to users, or used
in other permission sets.

Unless you are writing a permission module, you should never need to provide
this interface.

The service should be idempotent, since it may get called again, if something
went wrong with enabling the module. It should start by deleting all permissions
and permission sets for the named module, and then insert those it received in
the request. That way it will clean up permissions that may have been introduced
in some older version of the module, and are no longer used.

For the [specifics](#web-service), see under `.../okapi/okapi-core/src/main/raml/raml-util`
the files `ramls/tenant.raml` and `schemas/moduleInfo.schema`.
The okapi-test-header-module
has a very trivial implementation of this, and the moduleTest shows a module
Descriptor that define this interface.

The tenantPermissions interface was introduced in version 1.1


### Instrumentation

Okapi pushes instrumentation data to a Carbon/Graphite backend, from which
they can be shown with something like Grafana. Vert.x pushes some numbers
automatically, but various parts of Okapi push their own numbers explicitly,
so we can classify by tenant or module. Individual
modules may push their own numbers as well, as needed. It is hoped that they
will use a key naming scheme that is close to what we do in Okapi.

Enabling the metrics via `-enable-metrics` will start sending metrics to `localhost:2003`

If you add `graphiteHost` as a parameter to your java command,
e.g.
`java -DgraphiteHost=graphite.yourdomain.io -jar okapi-core/target/okapi-core-fat.jar dev -enable-metrics`
then metrics will be sent to `graphite.yourdomain.io`

  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.proxy.`_\$TENANT_`.`_\$HTTPMETHOD_`.`_\$PATH`_ -- Time for the whole request, including all modules that it ended up invoking.
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.proxy.`_\$TENANT_`.module.`_\$SRVCID`_ -- Time for one module invocation.
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.tenants.count` -- Number of tenants known to the system
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.tenants.`_\$TENANT_`.create` -- Timer on the creation of tenants
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.tenants.`_\$TENANT_`.update` -- Timer on the updating of tenants
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.tenants.`_\$TENANT_`.delete` -- Timer on deleting tenants
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.modules.count` -- Number of modules known to the system
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.deploy.`_\$SRVCID_`.deploy` -- Timer for deploying a module
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.deploy.`_\$SRVCID_`.undeploy` -- Timer for undeploying a module
  * `folio.okapi.`_\$HOST_`.deploy.`_\$SRVCID_`.update` -- Timer for updating a module

The `$`_NAME_ variables will of course get the actual values.

There are some examples of Grafana dashboard definitions in
the `doc` directory:

* [`grafana-main-dashboard.json`](grafana-main-dashboard.json)
* [`grafana-module-dashboard.json`](grafana-module-dashboard.json)
* [`grafana-node-dashboard.json`](grafana-node-dashboard.json)
* [`grafana-tenant-dashboard.json`](grafana-tenant-dashboard.json)

Here are some examples of useful graphs in Grafana. These can be pasted directly under the
metric, once you change edit mode (the tool menu at the end of the line) to text
mode.

  * Activity by tenant:

      `aliasByNode(sumSeriesWithWildcards(stacked(folio.okapi.localhost.proxy.*.*.*.m1_rate, 'stacked'), 5, 6), 4)`
  * HTTP requests per minute (also for PUT, POST, DELETE, etc)

      `alias(folio.okapi.*.vertx.http.servers.*.*.*.*.get-requests.m1_rate, 'GET')`
  * HTTP return codes (also for 4XX and 5XX codes)

      `alias(folio.okapi.*.vertx.http.servers.*.*.*.*.responses-2xx.m1_rate, '2XX OK')`
  * Modules invoked by a given tenant

      `aliasByNode(sumSeriesWithWildcards(folio.okapi.localhost.SOMETENANT.other.*.*.m1_rate, 5),5)`
